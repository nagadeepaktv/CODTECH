Overview of the Project
Project: To-Do List Web Application

Objective
This project aims to create a simple, interactive To-Do List application that allows users to add, manage, and track their tasks using a web browser.

Key Activities
1.	Add a Task:
    o	Users can input a task in a text box and click the "Add" button to append it to the task list.
    o	The addTask() function validates input, dynamically creates a new list item, and adds it to the list.
2.	Mark Task as Completed:
    o	Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking the ✔ button next to them.
    o	The toggleComplete() function applies a line-through style using the completed CSS class.
3.	Delete a Task:
    o	Users can remove a task by clicking the ✖ button.
    o	The deleteTask() function removes the corresponding task element from the DOM.

Technologies Used
1.	HTML:
    o	Provides the structure of the page, including input fields, buttons, and task list elements (<ul> and <li>).
2.	CSS:
    o	Styles the page with a clean and simple layout.
    o	Defines the .completed class for visual feedback on completed tasks.
3.	JavaScript:
    o	Adds interactivity to the application.
    o	Handles task addition, completion toggling, and deletion dynamically using DOM manipulation.
